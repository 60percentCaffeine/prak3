# Unix shell

The final homework assignment for the course was a Unix shell.
The task was broken into 3 subtasks. The latest version is "shell3".

Features:
- Command history and the "history" command
- I/O redirection (>>, 2>, >, \<, \|)
- Terminate the process on Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP)
- Working directories (cd, pwd)
