Classwork - notes from class.  
kr folders - tests.  
Everything else is homework... most likely :)  

# Unix shell

The final homework assignment for the course was a Unix shell.  
The task was broken into 3 subtasks. The latest version is "shell3".

Features:
- Command history and the "history" command
- I/O redirection (>>, 2>, >, \<, \|)
- Process termination on Ctrl+Z (SIGTSTP)
- Working directories (cd, pwd)
